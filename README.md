## Mobile Manipulator for Wheat Bale Handling Simulation

### Project Overview

This project presents a mobile manipulator simulation developed in MATLAB and Simulink, designed specifically for wheat bale handling. The simulation environment utilizes the powerful features of SimScape to model the robot and its interactions with the environment, offering realistic physics-based simulations.

### System Requirements

To run the simulation, ensure you have the following:

1. MATLAB version greater than or equal to 2019a.
2. Robotics Systems Toolbox.

### Folder Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **Cache**: Temporary files generated during simulation.
- **Libraries**: Contains relevant libraries.
- **SM_Link_Models**: Simulink models used in the simulation.
- **URDF_Models**: Mechanical models in URDF format.
- **Utilities**: MATLAB functions and files to initialize the model data.
- **Manipulator_Kinematics_Analytical.mlx**: MATLAB Live Script for manipulator kinematics.
- **startup.m**: Script to set up the simulation environment.

### Running the Simulation

1. Ensure you have the required MATLAB version and have installed the Robotics Systems Toolbox.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `startup.m` script to set up the simulation environment.
4. To explore manipulator kinematics analytically, open the `Manipulator_Kinematics_Analytical.mlx` Live Script.

### Simulation Environment

The simulation environment offers an interactive experience of controlling and observing the mobile manipulator for wheat bale handling. Simulink models in `SM_Link_Models` represent the robot and its interactions, while URDF models in `URDF_Models` define mechanical properties.
